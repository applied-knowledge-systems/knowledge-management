We start with a generalised term and keep getting more and more specific.

Almost anything may be classified according to some taxonomic scheme, as long as there's a logical hierarchy. Moving "up" in taxonomy leads to more generic terms moving down - more specific.

Formal taxonomies example - species classification taxonomy.
