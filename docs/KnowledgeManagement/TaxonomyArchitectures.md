#  Taxonomy Architectures
##  Flat Taxonomies
- Group contents into a controlled set of categories
- Alphabetical listing of people is a flat taxonomy 
- Lists of countries or states
- list of currencies
- Controlled vocabularies 
- List of security classification values ??? This is two dimentional

## Hierarchical Taxonomies
-  Structure contenct into at least two levels
-  Hieararchies are bi-derectional 
-  Each direction has meaning
-  Moving up the hieararchy means expanding the category or concept
-  Movind down the hieararchy means refining the category or the concept

## Facet Taxonomies
- Facets can descript a property or value
- Facets can represent different views or aspects of a single topic
- The contents of each attribute may have other kinds of taxonomies associated with them
- Facets are attributes - their values are called facet values
- Meaning in the structure derives from the association of the categories to the object or primary topic
- Put a person in the centre of a facet taxonomy

## Network Taxonomy
- Taxonomy which organizes contenct into both hierarchical and associative categories
- Combination of hieararchy and start architectures
- Any two nodes in a network taxonomy may be linked
- Categories or concepts are linked to one another based on the nature of their associations 
- Links may have more complex meaningful than we find in hierarchical taxonomies
